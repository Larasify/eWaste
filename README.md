Most people have eWaste - electronic waste - sitting in drawers at home, including old smartphones,
laptops, tablets, consoles, televisions, etc.

There are many reasons these devices should be recycled as soon as possible, including:

● Their value is higher the sooner they are recycled, e.g. if sold

● *They will be more likely to be used, and also used for longer, by their next owners.

● *If they are not working, the parts they contain are more useful the sooner they are made
available

There are also many reasons why people keep devices, including:

● *They are concerned that their data might be stolen if they don’t ‘wipe’ them first, e.g.
gaining access to their bank accounts, etc.

● Devices are seen as a backup if their current device is stolen (though in reality this may be
unlikely since newer devices are faster and owners typically move on to a new contract/device)

● *They still have data on them, e.g photos, game saves, etc.

● They have personal memories and are kept as part of a collection

eWaste recycling facilities are available and also data cleansing facilities, but these often export the
problem to other countries, e.g. see
https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/what-is-ewaste-and-what-can-we-do-about-it.html

This project focuses on the *items above by proposing that owners can be offered a service that will
retrieve data from devices as well as wiping them clean before they are then (when possible) reused
locally (reducing the carbon footprint of shipping them elsewhere), broken into spare parts for use
nationally or ultimately recycled ethically (i.e. without child labour, etc.) either within the UK, or local to
where the recycled materials will be reused.

The project aims to offer a hub where devices can be identified according to age and demand with an
option for owners to pay for data retrieval. Where devices might be resold, e.g. newish smart phones,
etc., then the hub should identify third parties where the owner might sell their device, with a referrer fee
paid by the third party for successful reselling. The seller would still be offered an option of having data
retrieved and their device wiped (with the fee).

The Hub will be a web application with web server/database with desktop being essential (optionally a
mobile web browser interface as well).
